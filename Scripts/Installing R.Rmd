## Installing R

R is a programming language and cannot be downloaded from the App Store etc. Its a slightly different installation process.  

To make R run on your system, you need to do two things. 
1. Install R (the language)
2. Install R Studio

Well, technically you can get away without doing step 2 but that is a discussion for another day. For now lets say you need to do both. 

##### To install R 

Go to the following website and download R for Windows or Mac

https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/

For Windows , Click on : R for Windows --------> Install R for the first time ------> Download R 4.1.3

###### To install R Studio 

Go to the following website and install R Studio

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Click on the Download button on R Studio Desktop Free. 



 Follow the installation process for both files. 
 
 Congratulations. You have successfully installed R.
